I have been trained in the following natural healthcare modalities: Zen Body Therapy, Iridology and BodyTalk Whole Body Health System. My website is not yet up and running, but will live in June. I also teach classes is healing using essential oils. I enjoy meeting people where they are in their health journey and enjoy being their guide along the path to true wellness.
