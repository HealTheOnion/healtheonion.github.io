In 2012, I became a Licensed Massage Therapist (LMT) by the State of Mississippi and worked in the Hattiesburg, MS area. In 2013 my family moved back to Leavenworth, KS. I became a Licensed Massage Therapist by the City of Leavenworth and began working as a LMT in Leavenworth.

My massage school education, beginning in Tacoma, WA (2010) and graduating in Hattiesburg, MS (2012) includes over 900 hours. My continuing education is additional 200 plus hours.

I am now a Licensed Massage Therapist at Elemental Wellness Spa, newely open in historic downtown Leavenworth, KS. We are west of the Post Office (4th &Shawnee). Located at 425 Shawnee Street, we are the 2 story adobe building directly across from City Hall, and are accessible via our private parking.
