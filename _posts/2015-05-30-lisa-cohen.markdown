Lisa Cohen, CNM

My name is Lisa Cohen, and I am proud to serve Kansas City and the surrounding areas as a home birth midwife. I opened Awakened Birthing in 2009 and while I love birth in any setting, home birth is my favorite place to be with birthing families. My passion as a midwife is providing families with true informed consent. This means that choosing me as your midwife will ensure discussions about all matters related to your pregnancy, with options regarding testing, technology, and birthing preferences. I believe I am here to educate you, support you, and guide you through your pregnancy.

I began my journey to midwifery as a Registered Nurse in 1998; my undergraduate degree was earned at the University of Central Missouri in Warrensburg. I knew at that time I would someday go on to midwifery, but I fell in love with critical care nursing and spent10 years working in critical care units. I completed my midwifery training in 2008 through a distance learning program with the State University of New York at Stony Brook. I have been fortunate to work in a variety of settings as a Certified Nurse Midwife, ranging from hospital, to free- standing birth center, to home birth.

My philosophy of care is influenced by my own personal and professional experiences. I believe in educating families about their options so they are able to make choices that are best for them and for their families. I believe that proper nutrition is the basis for one’s health or one’s disease and dietary correction should be given first consideration in healing. I believe that the vast majority of mothers are capable of birthing babies safely at home, warmly supported by people of their choosing. I believe babies should go straight into their mothers’ arms at the moment of birth. I believe that birth is a life-changing experience, but having a great birth can be a life- empowering experience.

I want to help all mothers have great births!
