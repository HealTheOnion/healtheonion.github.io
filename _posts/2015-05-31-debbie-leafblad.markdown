Alternative medicine has fascinated me from the moment I was introduced to it.  I feel fortunate to have found the Body Talk System.  It has enlightened me to a whole new perspective in health and well being, a search I had been on for years. BodyTalk combines everything I was looking for in health care because it integrates traditional Western allopathic medicine, ancient Eastern philosophies and modern psychology.

The healing and improved quality of life that I experienced through my sessions sparked me to further pursue BodyTalk on another level, by becoming a certified practitioner.  My greatest satisfaction is seeing similar results with my family, friends and clients. As I studied the system and practiced on friends and family, I was delighted with their positive experiences and fascinated at how simply and effectively BodyTalk caters to so many health issues.  

I am dedicated to helping everyone feel better and gain more from life.  I am constantly amazed at the simplicity of how BodyTalk works and love to share this with others.
