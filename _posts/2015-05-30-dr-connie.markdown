I provide both chiropractic and natural health treatment options in my Johnson County office located in the heart of Merriam, Kansas. I started in chiropractic care in 1979 and worked as a chiropractic assistant until I received my doctorate from Cleveland Chiropractic College in 1994. I have dedicated myself to providing the best holistic approach to help people live healthier, pain-free lives.

I value the time I spend with each of my clients and the difference I help make in their lives. Through my years of chiropractic care, I have seen chiropractic do amazing things. Often patients crawl into my office only to walk upright on the way out.

I believe that as a caring chiropractor, I must analyze the mechanics of the body and do what it takes to resolve problems for you as cost effectively as possible.

Your body consists of three main components: physical, mental/emotional, and spiritual. If one of these components is out of balance your body is being negatively affected. In addition to the chiropractic, myofacial massage, and acupuncture I address these with a variety of gentle approaches including; Bach Flower Remedies, Homeopathic Remedies, Vitamins, Herbs and methods of relaxation and meditation.
